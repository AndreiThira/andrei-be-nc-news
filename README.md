# Northcoders News API

Developed a feature-rich RESTful API serving articles, topics, and user-generated comments. This API empowers users with comprehensive access to content, allowing them to effortlessly explore articles, discover topics, and participate in vibrant discussions. Key functionalities include seamless GET requests for reading articles and topics, as well as interactive features like comment posting and voting via PATCH requests.

### Technologies Used <a name="TechUsed"></a>
- **Express.js:** The primary backend framework for building the RESTful API. 
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful and reliable relational database used to store and manage data in the project. 
- **CORS:** Middleware used to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing for secure communication between the client and the server.
- **dotenv:** A utility for managing environment variables, enhancing the configuration of the project.

See [Acknowledgments](#Acknowledgments) for additional libraries used.

### Deployment <a name="Deployment"></a>
**Render for API Hosting**    
I have deployed the RESTful API using [Render](https://render.com/), a powerful platform for hosting web applications. This ensures that our API is highly available and scales effortlessly to meet user demand.You can access our API [here](https://nc-news-sem6.onrender.com/api).

**Database Instance with ElephantSQL**  
For my database needs, I rely on [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/), a managed PostgreSQL database service. This hosted database instance ensures data durability, reliability, and scalability.

### Installation guide <a name="Installation"></a>
In order to run the API locally:   
1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Open the directory in VS.
3. In the terminal, run ```npm i``` in order to install all the required dependencies.
4. In order to connect to the relavant database, you need to define the environmental variable PGDATABASE:
    1. In the root folder, create a .env.development and a .env.test file. If you wish to use a hosted database which is ready for production, you can also create a .env.production file.
    2. Inside .env.development, paste ```PGDATABASE=nc_news```
    3. Inside .env.test, paste ```PGDATABASE=nc_news_test```
   
   The values of PGDATABASE can be changed according to the name of your desired database. If you wish to add a hosted database, set the value of PGDATABASE to the link provided by your hosting provider.   
6. In the terminal, run the command ```npm run seed``` to seed the database.
7. In the terminal, enter the command ```npm start``` to run the server. By default, the port when running the server is 9090, this can be changed in the **listen.js** module. 
8. Test by using an API client such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or your browser and execute a GET request at http://localhost:9090/api where a response should be served with a list of available endpoints.
